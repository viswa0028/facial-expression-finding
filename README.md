# facial-expression-finding
In this python code we will be using CNN to create a model to identify different facial expression.
We will be using Pathlib to read the images in the path and we will be using cv2 to convert the images into a array and work with the array
We will be using keras to create a neural network and try to increase its accuracy for better output.
